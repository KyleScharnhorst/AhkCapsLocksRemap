# AhkCapsLocksRemap

Great for Vim!

Remaps Capslock to Esc (https://autohotkey.com/docs/misc/Remap.htm)

Shift + Capslock will still activate normal Capslock functionality.

1. Download autohotkey (https://autohotkey.com/).
1. Place the .ahk script into the startup folder (run "shell:startup" to find on Windows) (https://autohotkey.com/docs/FAQ.htm#Startup). This allows the script to always be active, as it is ran on startup.
1. Run the Script to go into effect now.
1. Test and profit.
